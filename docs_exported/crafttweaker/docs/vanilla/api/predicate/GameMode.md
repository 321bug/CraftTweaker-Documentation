# GameMode

Represents the various kinds of game modes that are available within the game.

 A game mode indicates how the player should experience the game and with which restrictions. Refer to the
 documentation of the various entries for a description.

## Importing the class

It might be required for you to import the package if you encounter any issues (like casting an Array), so better be safe than sorry and add the import at the very top of the file.
```zenscript
import crafttweaker.api.predicate.GameMode;
```


## Extending Enum&lt;GameMode&gt;
