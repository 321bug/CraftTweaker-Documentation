# WeightedItemStack
A Weighted Item Stack is like a normal [IItemStack](IItemStack) but has a percentage added to it.  
You normally use them when dealing with percentage based actions like drops or secondary outputs.

## Calling a weightedItemStack
You can derive a weightedItemStack from an [IItemStack](IItemStack) by either using the modulo operator or the weight function on it.

```
val itemStack = <minecraft:dirt>;

//both create a weightedItemstack object with a chance of 20%
val wItemStack = itemStack % 20;
val wItemStack2 = itemStack.weight(0.2);
```
