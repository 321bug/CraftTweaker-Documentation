#Getting Started with scripts

Crafttweaker uses a custom scripting Language called `ZenScript`, Zenscript is read from `.zs` files that are stored in the `<gamedir>/scripts` folder.

ZenScript is a "top down" scripting language, meaning that, `Imports` need to be at the top of the file, `Variable Declarions` should be near the top of the file, however there are no restrictions to that, a `Variable` can be defined anywhere i na script, however it will not be accessible to the lines above the `Variable` declaration.
