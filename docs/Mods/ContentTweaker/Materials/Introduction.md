# Contenttweaker Material System
Contenttweaker allows you not only to add single items to the game but whole materials!
You can for example use these materials to automatically generate a new ore together with gears, ingots and the like!

There are 5 Terms that are important:

- [Material](/Mods/ContentTweaker/Materials/Materials/Material): The Material you are going to add/use (e.g. Platinum) → What the items are made of
- [PartType](/Mods/ContentTweaker/Materials/Parts/PartType): Basically a group (e.g. Block, Item, Entity, etc) → The type of the parts
- [Part](/Mods/ContentTweaker/Materials/Parts/Part): The item's form (e.g. Gear, Rod, Ingot, etc)
- [MaterialPart](/Mods/ContentTweaker/Materials/Materials/MaterialPart): Combination of Part and Material (e.g. Iron rod, Platinum Gear, etc) → Can be used to return the item as [IItemStack](/Vanilla/Items/IItemStack) later on.
- [MaterialPartData](/Mods/ContentTweaker/Materials/Parts/MaterialPartData): Some configurations → Varies by part type, check the wiki page for further information.
